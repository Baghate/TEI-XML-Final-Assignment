                    <p>
                        <lb/>I am writing to you about tentative plans for assembling a small symposium to discuss <hi><term>Historicism</term></hi>
                        We are at the moment concerned mainly with subject matter. No decisions have yet been made about date, site, nnumers, or foundation
                        support. <date>Fall 1972</date> or <date>Spring 1973</date> are probable dates. I should greatly appreciate your help, answers,
                        and comments -- including negative comments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/>The overall objectives of the symposium would be any (or all) of the following: (1) To discuss the history of the impact
                        of <term>historicism</term> on some of the established disciplines. (2) To learn where <term>historicism</term> stands today
                        . (3) To attemps to reduce the variety of usages of the term <term>"historicism"</term> to some workable characterization and,
                        as a service to scholarshop, publicize our findings in <hi>History and Theory.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/>It would help in planning to determine what kind or kinds of <term>"historicism"</term> the symposium should usefully
                        confine itself. This need not be in contradiction to objective (3) ; it could be the first step towards it. For example,
                        Professor<persName>Mandelbaum</persName> -- at length in his recent <title>History, Man and Reason</title> and more briefly in his 
                        enclosed <title>Encyclopedia</title> article -- defines the term as the undestanding of phenomena through their place in a process 
                        of <hi>development.</hi> As a <hi>methodological principle</hi>, rather than a <term><foreign>Weltanschauung</foreign></term>
                        , he sees it to be relevant to such current topics of discussion as <persName>Piaget</persName>'s <term>developmentalism</term>, 
                        <term>structuralism</term> and as a reevaluation of <term>Marxism</term> (regarding <term>orthodox Marxism</term>as <term>historicist</term>
                        and <term>Marxian humanism</term>as <term>anti-historicist</term>). QUite differnt issues might be raised by other kinds of
                        characterizations, e.g. by <persName>Popper</persName>'s linking of <term>historicism</term> to <term>"holism"</term>(involving
                        i.a. the concepts of "laws") or by the identification of <term>historicism</term> with a concept of <term>"historicity"</term>of relevance to theology).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/><hi>Do you agree that our undertaking requires some prior narrowing down of the term, and if so, have you any wider-ranging
                        associations of <term>"historicism</term>in mind that might usefully be played down or excluded?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/>Participating speakers and auditors would mostrly represent specific disciplines.These might include "history" (perhaps a 
                        sruvey of the classic development of <term>historicism</term>), "historicim and art history", "historicim and philosophy", "historical
                        theology", "historicim and economics", as wells as, perhaps, "historicism and science" and the more recent "historicism and black history".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/><hi>Would you be willing, in principle, to attend? Could you also let me know on what topic you may
                        wish to read a paper (or shorter comment on some problem, book, or thinker)?</hi>
